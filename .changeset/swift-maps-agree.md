# Add Codestral as a free alternative to Mistral API

### Description

Added Codestral as a new LLM provider that offers a free alternative to Mistral's paid API. Key changes include:

* Added new `CodestralHandler` class implementing the `ApiHandler` interface
* Integrated Codestral model definitions with appropriate token limits and pricing (free for personal use)
* Updated UI to support Codestral API key configuration and model selection
* Fixed Mistral console URL to point to the correct domain
* Reused Mistral message format transformation since both APIs share similar structure

The implementation leverages the existing Mistral client but configures it to use Codestral's endpoint, allowing users to benefit from similar capabilities while avoiding usage costs.

### Test Procedure

* Verified Codestral provider initialization with custom endpoint
* Tested message streaming functionality works correctly
* Confirmed proper token usage tracking
* Validated UI changes for provider selection and API key configuration
* Ensured model selection dropdown displays correct Codestral models
* Tested error handling for invalid API keys and failed requests
* Verified links to console for obtaining API keys work correctly
